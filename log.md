# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 21 March 2023
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started coding continously again. Created schedule and started implimenting.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
